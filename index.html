WITHOUT LOSING YOUR TEMPER OR YOUR SELF CONFIDENCE~ ROBERT FROST">

<ul>
<li>Donâ€™t take rest after your first victory because if you fail in second,
more lips are waiting to say that your first victory was just luck.</li>

<li>Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life--think of it, dream of it
live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body
be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. 
This is the way to success.</li>

<li>All of us do not have equal talent. But, all of us have an equal opportunity
 to develop our talents</li>

<li>You cannot change your future, but, you can change your habits,
 and surely your habits will change your future.</li>

<li>Look at the sky. We are not alone. The whole universe is friendly to us and
 conspires only to those who dream and work.</li>

<li>In a day, when you don't come across any problems - you can be sure that 
you are travelling in a wrong path</li>

<li>Have faith in yourselves, great convictions are the mothers of great deeds.</li>
</ul>
