 the more often you do something, the more confident you’ll be in doing it. In other areas, 
confidence can be a product of your practiced habits for example, if you work on improving your body language, improving your elocution, and thinking positive thoughts, you’ll naturally come across as a more confident person, and you’ll feel more confident in your regular actions.</p>
