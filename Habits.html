<ol>
<p>
<li><strong>Focus on what you have.Why?</strong><br />
We spend a great deal of time immersed in our problems.
 But problems are also a sign of life  if you want to shift your focus away from your problems
, you have to be grateful for what you have. </li></p>
<p>
<li><strong>Smiling is good therapy.Why?</strong><br />
Studies have confirmed that people who smile a genuine smile (also referred to as a Duchenne smile) are happier in life.
 This is one of the best habits for allowing you to find emotional, mental and spiritual peace-of-
mind over time -- simply by placing a smile on your face.</li></p>
<p>
<li><strong>Good days begin with a healthy breakfast.Why?</strong><br />
Breakfast is an important part of life And that saying you've heard your entire life about breakfast being the most important meal of the day?
 It's 100 percent true. If you're serious about success, eat a healthy breakfast every single morning.</li></p>
<p>
<li><strong>Drink water with lemon.Why?</strong><br />
One habit that has monumental health benefits is to drink a large glass of water with lemon every single day. 
Lemons are a natural source of Vitamin C, but also possess other health benefits -- such as helping with your digestion,
 boosting your immune system</li></p>
<p>
<li><strong>Exercise every day.Why?</strong><br />
One of the absolute best habits to have in life is to exercise every single day without fail. This isn't about heavy weightlifting 
or running a marathon. This is about doing lightly strenuous activity to oxygenate your blood 
and boost the endorphins in your body.</li></p> 
<p>
<li><strong>Manage your time at least as well as you manage your money.Why?</strong><br />
An essential habit for succeeding at anything in life is effective time management. How well you manage the precious little
 time you have says a lot about what you can achieve. And considering that we all have the same amount of time in this world,
 how you leverage this resource will dictate your potential for success.</li></p>
<p>
<li><strong>Daily goals, every day.Why?</strong><br />
Most people have goals. Whether it's something to achieve in business or in life, we're all moving in one intended direction or another. However, while long-term goals do give us direction, it's the daily goals that we set that allow us to create short-term milestones that are integral to our success.</li></p>
